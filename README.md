Data Science Project Portfolio

# Project 1 : Exploration Data Analysis
- This shows that you can clearly tell a story with your data. It also shows that you can collect, clean, and perform feature   engineering. I recommend scraping your data or collecting it from an open api.
  

# Project 2 : Classification
- With these projects you are predicting a binary or categorical outcome. An example would be the titanic dataset where you predict if    people would have survived the crash. 
  

# Project 3 : Regression
-  In these types of analyses, you try to predict a continuous outcome. An example would be predicting how many likes a youtube video would get

# Project 4 : Clustering
- With this we use algorithms to understand which data points are related to eachother.
